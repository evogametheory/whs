<h2 align>Overview</h2>


<p>Population games provide a general model of strategic interactions among large numbers of agents; network congestion, multilateral externalities, and natural selection are among their many applications.  As the direct assumption of equilibrium play seems difficult to justify in these games, behavior is most naturally modeled as a dynamic adjustment processes.  To accomplish this, one can begin with an explicit stochastic description of how individual agents make decisions.  When the number of agents is large enough and the time horizon of interest not too long, the evolution of aggregate behavior is well approximated by solutions to ordinary differential equations.  We discuss various classes of population games in which these deterministic evolutionary dynamics lead to equilibrium play, and also consider simple examples in which more complicated limit behavior occurs.  If one is interested in behavior over very long time spans, one studies the stochastic evolutionary processes directly, focusing on their ergodic and large deviations properties.

<p>Many of the mathematical techniques used in evolutionary game theory are not part of the standard economics curriculum.  To make evolution more accessible to graduate students in economics and other fields, the book includes detailed appendices on topics in multivariate calculus, convex analysis, dynamical systems, and stochastic processes that are essential for understanding evolutionary models.  The book also includes many color figures, created using the shareware program <a href="../dynamo/index.html">Dynamo</a>, to present population games and evolutionary dynamics in an intuitive, geometric fashion.
