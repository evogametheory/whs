<h2 align=center>Bill Sandholm's Archive</h2>

<hr>
<p>This website archives papers, software, and teaching materials created by Bill Sandholm (1970 - 2020). It was launched in October 2022 after Bill's homepage was shut down. I preserved the structure and the design of the original homepage, removed contact information and broken links, and brought the list of publications up to date.   ~<a href="mailto:g.loginov@gmail.com">GL</a></p>

<p>July 2023 update: Bill's homepage was restored. The department of Economics at UW-Madison is organizing <a href="https://econ.wisc.edu/bill-sandholm-memorial-workshop/"> a memorial workshop </a> for Bill on Sept 29 and Sept 30, 2023. </p>

<p>My name is Bill Sandholm, and I'm the Stockwell Chair in <a href="http://www.econ.wisc.edu/">Economics</a> at the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</a>.  My main area of research is game theory, which is the mathematical study of interactive decision making.
