<h3>Introduction to Dynamo</h3>


<p>Dynamo is a suite of easy-to-use <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica</a> notebooks for generating phase diagrams, vector fields, and other graphics related to evolutionary game dynamics.</p> 

<p>The four phase diagrams above were generated using four of the five 
Dynamo workbooks.  (In the first two figures, colors reflect speed of 
motion:  blue is slowest, red is fastest.) </p>

</li></ul>

<p>Dynamo now takes advantage of Mathematica's ability to perform <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/whs/dynamo/3D.html">live rotation of three-dimensional graphics</a>.</p>

<h3>Learning Dynamo</h3>


<p>Francisco Franchetti and I have written an <a href="dynamo.pdf">introduction to Dynamo</a>.
  We describe how to use the software's default settings to generate 
phase diagrams quickly and easily. We then explain how to take advantage
 of the software's intermediate and advanced features to create diagrams
 that highlight the key properties of the dynamical system under study. 
Sample code and output are provided to help demonstrate the software's 
capabilities.</p>

<p>Dynamo v1.3 - v1.4 runs in Mathematica versions 6 and later. 
It does not run in Mathematica 4 or 5.  For the legacy version (0.1.5) that does, visit <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/whs/dynamo/legacy.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Working with Dynamo</h3>

<p>Dynamo is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">free</a>, <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> software.  </p>

<h3>Project history</h3>
<p> In 2003, I began working on Dynamo when I realized I would need to create many illustrations of game dynamics for  </a><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12312">my book on evolutionary game theory</a><a>.  </a><a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~edokumac/">Emin Dokumaci</a> was the lead programmer of Dynamo from 2003-2007, and did most of the coding of the Mathematica 4/5 version of the software.</p>  

<p> In 2007, Wolfram released Mathematica 6, which included some 
impressive new features (like rotatable 3D graphics), but also many 
small changes in the programming language that made code written for 
older versions of Mathematica behave badly.  Grrrr.  So the code was 
frozen, until...

</p><p> In 2010, <a href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/franchetti/web/">Francisco Franchetti</a> became the new lead programmer of Dynamo, and he gamely updated the Dynamo code to run Mathematica 6/7.</p>

<p> In April 2011, Francisco and I completed a polished version of 
Dynamo 3S, which we have (after only eight years!) dubbed version 1.0.  
The corresponding updates of the other notebooks are underway.</p>

<p> In March 2012, Francisco and I finished <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/whs/research/dynamo.pdf">a paper</a> explaining how to use Dynamo, and posted a polished version of Dynamo 4S.</p>

<p> In July 2013, Francisco and I posted version 1.3 of Dynamo.  This 
new posting includes a fifth notebook for two-population, 3 x 2 strategy
 games, as well as polished versions of the other two notebooks for 
multipopulation games.  As part of this update, the code has been made 
much more consistent across the different notebooks.</p>

<h3>Other free game theory software</h3>

<p><a href="https://luis-r-izquierdo.github.io/EvoDyn-3s/"><i>EvoDyn-3s</i></a>,
 by Luis Izquierdo, Segis Izquierdo, and me, is "baby Dynamo".  It draws
 phase diagrams for three-strategy symmetric games, and is presented 
using a very simple graphical user interface.  <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/whs/dynamo/2018_SX.pdf">Introduction to <i>EvoDyn-3s</i></a>.</p> 

<p><a href="https://luis-r-izquierdo.github.io/abed"><i>ABED: Agent-Based Evolutionary Game Dynamics</i></a>,
 also by Luis Izquierdo, Segis Izquierdo, and me, runs agent-based 
simulations of evolutionary game theory models based on a wide range of 
revision protocols.  It runs in the wonderful <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> modeling  environment.  <a href="http://luis.izqui.org/papers/abed.pdf">Introduction to <i>ABED</i></a>.</p> 


<p>The <a href="http://www.gambit-project.org/doc/index.html">Gambit</a>
 library, by Richard McKelvey, Andy McLennan, and Ted Turocy, provides a
 variety of tools for drawing and (especially) solving normal and 
extensive form games.</p> 

<p>Christoph Hauert's <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/virtuallabs/">VirtualLabs in evolutionary game theory</a>
 provides tools for studying evolutionary dynamics in spatial games - 
that is, games played by agents located at points on lattices or other 
graphs.  The animations are amazing - see for yourself!</p>

<p>Julián García and Matthijs van Veelen maintain an <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/virtuallabs/">Evolution and Games wiki</a>.
  It provides Java applets for running simulations of evolutionary game 
models, as well as tutorials on various topics in evolutionary game 
theory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kcons.eu/birds/">birds</a>, by Kristaps Dzonsons and Jörgen Weibull, is a utility for simulating stochastic evolutionary game dynamics.</p>
